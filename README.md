A webapp that can select a random Disney villain that is available in the Villainous board game by Ravensburger.  

Currently, this does not display well on mobile devices. Until I fix it, you can go to your mobile browsers settings and change it to desktop mode.

Updates to do:  
Better audio clips  
Add effects when a villain is selected  
Create a slot reel effect when th button is pressed 
Optimize for mobile users
